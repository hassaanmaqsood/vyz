### The Instant Browser Studio

**Vyz** is a lightweight, account-free media tool designed for quick recordings and neat presentations. Layer your camera and screen in professional layouts directly in your browser.

---

## 1. Getting Started

To begin, provide Vyz with your media feeds:

* **Camera:** Click **"Camera"** to activate your webcam.
* **Mic:** Click **"Mic"** to enable audio.
* **Screen Share:** Click **"Screen Share"** to select a window, tab, or your entire desktop.

> **Privacy Note:** Vyz respects your privacy. All video processing and recording happen locally in your browser. Your data is never uploaded to a server.

## 2. Mastering the Frame (The Fit Modes)

One of the most powerful features of Vyz is the ability to control how your video fills its container.

* **Double-Click any Video Feed** to cycle between two modes:
* **Cover (Default):** The video fills the entire assigned area. This looks professional and "full," but may crop the edges of your feed.
* **Contain:** The entire video feed is visible without any cropping. This will add "letterboxing" (black bars) if the aspect ratio doesn't match perfectly.



---

## 3. Layouts & Controls

Once you have both **Camera** and **Screen Share** active, the layout engine unlocks:

* **Change Layout:** Cycle through **Side** (split-screen), **Stack** (vertical), and **PiP** (Picture-in-Picture).
* **Swap:** Instantly flip the position of your camera and screen.
* **Position:** In PiP mode, move your floating camera bubble to any of the four corners.
* **Canvas Settings:** Use the **Aspect Ratio** and **Orientation** buttons to prep your video for YouTube (16:9), Instagram (9:16), or LinkedIn (1:1).

## 4. Recording & Saving

1. **Start:** Click **Record**. A red **REC** indicator and timer will appear.
2. **During:** You can change layouts, swap feeds, and even toggle **Fit Modes** *while* recording. Vyz captures these transitions in real-time.
3. **Finish:** Click **Record** again to stop.
4. **Save:** Once stopped, Vyz automatically generates a high-quality `.webm` file and triggers a download to your device.

### Pro-Tip for Creators

If you are recording a detailed technical demo, use **Contain** mode on your screen share by double-clicking it. This ensures your viewers see every piece of code or UI detail without any edges being cut off.
